when i plug the network cable and use ./qt-http-206-example and then type 'q' and press RETURN it does not exit the program but
stays there for minutes.

## loosing network connection
when i unplug the network cable (host::eth0), the virtualbox guest can't detect it. this behaviour is not specific
to virtualization and affects all similar setups. for example if you unplug the network cable between your router to the switch
you have your test machine connected to.

 the virtualbox based setup i used:

   inet 
     |
     |   eth0|---------|   virtualized    |---------|
     \ ------|  host   |------------------|  guest  |
             |---------| vboxnet0    eth1 |---------|
                                       |
                                     inside the guest
                                      this interface is called eth1
                                      
             
this means, if i ping 8.8.8.8 from the guest, it will send these packages but they will end in nirvana:
 guest # ping 8.8.8.8
      PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.

someone else had the same discovery here:

  http://www.qtcentre.org/threads/41649-QNetworkAccessManager-smart-handling-of-timeouts-network-errors
  
## what causes the stall?
i think the conclusions from the both threads are wrong. this is a DNS timeout with 40 seconds and i can reproduce this by
modifying /etc/resolv.conf to, 'nameserver 127.0.0.1' so that the connection gets a immediate timeout instead of waiting
forever. however, the ping from above suggests that it detects a timeout very fast. 

the cause is probably the QHostInfo DNS resolver routine:
    int info = QHostInfo::lookupHost("www.qt-project.org", this, SLOT(printResults(QHostInfo)));
    //QHostInfo::abortHostLookup ( info );
    
./qhostinfo-test
0.01s user 0.01s system 0% cpu 40.057 total

the same program with the abortHostLookup(..) call, terminates instantly.

## solution for my issue
the QNetworkAccessManager makes use of QHostInfo and when the destructor of it is called it must call abortHostLookup(..) for all
related objects so that shutdown does not wait for the 40 seconds timeout.

# what is this
qt-http-206-example is a little example featuring how to do partial content 206 http downloads using QNetworkAccessManager
this code is a bit hacky, so pick what you need.
